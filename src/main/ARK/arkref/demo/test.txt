The Duke of Cambridge is rarely heard giving speeches in public and so under leaden skies today he had an opportunity to practise his technique on the people of Nottingham. In truth, so enthusiastic was the crowd he could have recited a Sandringham shopping list and won an ovation. In the event he spoke with confidence, expressing his sadness the Duke of Edinburgh could not be with the royal party today. He paid tribute to the Queen Elizabeth II Fields Challenge which protects parks and green spaces in the UK and he thanked the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh for the love and devotion they had shown the people of the Commonwealth over the past 60 years. His short speech brought an ecstatic response from the crowds in Vernon Park. The Queen planted a tree near one Queen Victoria planted for her Diamond Jubilee and signed the Stamford visitors' book. The Queen finished the trip in Corby, Northamptonshire. She arrived at the Corby East Midlands International Pool at 15:00 BST, where she watched diving and snorkelling displays. The Queen met Caitlin McClatchey, a member of the Team GB Olympic swimming team. Ms McClatchey said: "It's really nice that we can all really be part of one country now, as we will be in the summer, and that everyone can be here for the Queen. "She's been a figurehead of this country for 60 years and I feel so honoured and privileged to have been able to meet her." The Queen then travelled to The Cube to unveil a commemorative plaque and watch local musicians. Entertainment was provided by Scottish and Irish dancers and a pipe band to celebrate Corby's roots. Aimee Burlington, 16, was among three youngsters who presented the Queen with a posy. The teenager said: "She's a really lovely woman. I was very, very scared but it was great."
